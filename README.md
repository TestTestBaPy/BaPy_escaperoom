# Escaperoom Adventure - Where is my Emma? 

This project was created as part of the 'Basic Programming in Python' course at the University Osnabr√ºck.
It is based on the concept of an escape room, where you can examine the individual scenes by clicking on the screen. Each scene consists of 1-2 puzzles, only when solve the respective puzzles you can switch to the next scene.
If you manage to solve all the puzzles, you win the game!
