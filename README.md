# Escaperoom Adventure - Where is my Emma? 

This project was created as part of the 'Basic Programming in Python' course at the University Osnabr√ºck.
It is based on the concept of an escape room, where you can examine the individual scenes by clicking on the screen. Each scene consists of 1-2 puzzles, only when solve the respective puzzles you can switch to the next scene.
If you manage to solve all the puzzles, you win the game!

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
---------------------
In order to solve our puzzles you need to click on something on the screen. Sometimes you find a key, sometimes you find or reveal a part of the puzzle that is needed to solve it.
We hide some hints for you to keep your eyes open, anything can be useful, maybe it helps if you use pen and paper.
If you have the correct code to solve the puzzle you have to either use your keyboard or you have to click on numbers at your screen.
